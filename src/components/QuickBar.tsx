 This unit was supposed to show possible payment options.
 Unfortunately I couldn't come up with a reasonable algorithm that would make life easier for the cashier.
 The other algorithms I came up with lacked consistency.
 I have implemented a banknote based system.
 I could also add a "Bar Exact" button, which is missing here since maximum 5 buttons are expected.
 Yet it could be implemented quite easily.
